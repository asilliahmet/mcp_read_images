# Research Methodology for MCP Image Reader Project

## 🔧 Taskmaster Research Integration

### Using Taskmaster Research Tool
Instead of manual research documentation, use Taskmaster's built-in research capabilities:

```bash
# Example research commands that integrate with project context
task-master research "MCP protocol latest updates 2025" --save-to=1 --tree
task-master research "OpenRouter API changes vision models" --files=src/index.ts --save-to=1
task-master research "Sharp library performance optimization" --detail=high --save-file
```

### Research Workflow with Taskmaster
1. **Identify Research Need**: Create or update task with research requirement
2. **Execute Research**: Use `research` tool with project context
3. **Auto-Documentation**: Research saves directly to task details with timestamps
4. **Track Progress**: Research findings automatically integrated into task management

### File Organization
```
.taskmaster/docs/
├── research/
│   ├── mcp-protocol-implementation.md     # Historical research (this project)
│   ├── research-methodology.md            # This file
│   └── archived/                          # Completed research archives
├── templates/
│   └── research-template.md               # Template for manual research
└── prd.txt                               # Current project requirements
```

## 🎯 Benefits of Taskmaster Research Integration

### vs. Root Level MD Files
- ❌ **Root MD**: Disconnected from tasks, manual updates, version confusion
- ✅ **Taskmaster**: Integrated with tasks, timestamped, searchable, contextual

### Research Task Workflow
1. Research automatically includes project context (files, tasks, architecture)
2. Findings save directly to relevant tasks with timestamps
3. No manual copy/paste between research and implementation
4. Research history preserved in task details for future reference

### Example Research Integration
```typescript
// Instead of separate research.md, research gets saved directly to tasks:
Task 1: "Monitor MCP Protocol Updates"
├── Details: Auto-updated from research tool
├── Research History: Timestamped research conversations
└── Implementation Notes: Direct integration with findings
