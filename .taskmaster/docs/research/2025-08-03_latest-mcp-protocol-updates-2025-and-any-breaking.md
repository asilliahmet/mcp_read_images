# Research Session

## Initial Query

**Question:** Latest MCP protocol updates 2025 and any breaking changes that might affect our image analysis server implementation

**Response:**

The latest MCP protocol update, version 2025-06-18, introduces several breaking changes and enhancements that directly impact server implementations, including those for image analysis. The most significant updates are the removal of JSON-RPC batching, the introduction of structured tool outputs, major changes to OAuth-based security, and new capabilities for eliciting user input and referencing resources[1][2][3][4].

---

## Key Breaking Changes and Updates (2025-06-18)

### 1. **Removal of JSON-RPC Batching**
- **What Changed:** The ability to batch multiple JSON-RPC requests in a single call, introduced in MCP 2025-03-26, has been removed[1][2].
- **Impact:** If your image analysis server or any client expects to send or receive batched requests, this will break compatibility. Each request must now be handled individually.
- **Action:** Review your server’s request handling logic (e.g., in `src/index.ts`) to ensure it does not expect or process batched JSON-RPC messages.

### 2. **Structured Tool Output**
- **What Changed:** Tools can now return structured, predictable JSON data formats (via `structuredContent`), rather than only free-form text[1][2][3].
- **Impact:** This enables more robust integration and downstream processing of tool results. For your image analysis server, consider updating the `analyze_image` tool to optionally return structured results (e.g., detected objects, confidence scores) in addition to plain text.
- **Action:** Update your tool response schema to support and document structured outputs. This may involve changes to the `McpResponse<T>` interface and the tool handler logic.

### 3. **Enhanced OAuth Security**
- **What Changed:** MCP servers are now classified as OAuth 2.0 Resource Servers. Clients must include a `resource` parameter (per RFC 8707) when requesting tokens, binding each access token to a specific MCP server[1][2][3][4].
- **Impact:** Your server must implement stricter OAuth validation and token handling. The protocol now separates authentication and resource server roles, and all HTTP requests must include the `MCP-Protocol-Version` header.
- **Action:** Review your authentication middleware and ensure compliance with the new OAuth requirements. If your server is not yet using OAuth 2.0, migration is strongly recommended.

### 4. **Elicitation Capability**
- **What Changed:** Servers can now initiate requests for additional user input mid-session using `elicitation/create`, including a message and a JSON schema for expected input[1][2][3].
- **Impact:** This allows for more interactive workflows, such as clarifying ambiguous image analysis requests.
- **Action:** Consider implementing support for elicitation in your server, especially if your tools may require follow-up questions or clarification from users.

### 5. **Resource Links in Tool Results**
- **What Changed:** Tool results can now include `resource_link` types, allowing tools to reference external MCP resources (e.g., large images, logs) instead of inlining all data[1][2][3].
- **Impact:** For large image analysis outputs or logs, you can now return a URI for clients to fetch or subscribe to, improving efficiency.
- **Action:** Update your tool output logic to optionally return resource links where appropriate.

### 6. **Protocol Versioning and Headers**
- **What Changed:** All HTTP requests must include the `MCP-Protocol-Version` header. If missing, servers should default to `2025-03-26` for backward compatibility[2].
- **Impact:** This affects both server and client implementations.
- **Action:** Ensure your server checks for and responds to the `MCP-Protocol-Version` header, and documents its supported protocol version.

## Recommendations for Your Project

- **Documentation:** Update your MCP protocol documentation system to include a dedicated section for breaking changes and migration guides. Clearly document the removal of batching, new OAuth requirements, and structured output formats.
- **Codebase:** In `src/index.ts`, review the request handling logic for batching, update tool output schemas, and ensure all authentication flows comply with the new OAuth requirements.
- **Testing:** Add tests to verify that your server rejects batched requests, correctly handles structured tool outputs, and enforces the presence of the `MCP-Protocol-Version` header.
- **Monitoring:** Set up automated monitoring for future MCP protocol updates, as outlined in your Task 1 plan, to ensure ongoing compliance.

**Summary:**  
The MCP 2025-06-18 update introduces breaking changes—most notably the removal of JSON-RPC batching, stricter OAuth security, structured tool outputs, elicitation, and resource links. Immediate action is required to update your image analysis server and documentation to maintain compatibility and security[1][2][3][4].
